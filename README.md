## Abstract
H&M Group is a family of brands and businesses with 53 online markets and approximately 4,850 stores. With extensive selection of products to browse through, we unavoidably have the issue of too many choices. Customers might not find what interests them or what they are looking for, and ultimately, they might not make a purchase. To enhance the shopping experience, product recommendations are key. More importantly, helping customers make the right choices also has a positive implications for sustainability, as it reduces returns, and thereby minimizes emissions from transportation.



I experimented with several traditional and modern machine learning models that leverage Computer Vision. The best model I build was deep learning model.
